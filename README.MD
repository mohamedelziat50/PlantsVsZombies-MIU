## How to Run
To run the project, JavaFX must be installed and configured. Follow these steps for a smooth experience:

### Prerequisites
- **JavaFX SDK** (e.g., `javafx-sdk-23.0.1`).
- **IntelliJ IDEA** (recommended for easy setup, but other platforms, such as NetBeans, can also be used).

### Steps
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
2. **Configure JavaFX in IntelliJ:**
   - Go to `File -> Project Structure (CTRL + ALT + SHIFT + S)`.
   - Navigate to `Modules`.
   - Under your project, select `Dependencies` and click the `+` sign to add the JavaFX library.
     - Add the path to the `lib` folder of the JavaFX SDK, e.g., `E:\openjfx-23.0.1_windows-x64_bin-sdk\javafx-sdk-23.0.1\lib`.
3. **Edit VM Options:**
   - Go to `Run -> Edit Configurations`.
   - Add a new Application configuration and set the Main class to `MainGUI`.
   - In `VM Options`, add the following line (replace the path with your JavaFX SDK path):
     ```
     --module-path E:\openjfx-23.0.1_windows-x64_bin-sdk\javafx-sdk-23.0.1\lib --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml,javafx.media --add-opens javafx.base/com.sun.javafx=ALL-UNNAMED
     ```
4. **Run the Project:**
   Click `Run` to launch the game.

## Common Issues and Fixes
- **Missing JavaFX SDK:** Ensure the correct path to the JavaFX SDK is set in the project configuration.
- **Main Class Not Found:** Verify that the correct Main class is selected in the run configurations.
- **Platform Compatibility:** The project works best with IntelliJ but can be set up on NetBeans or other IDEs by following similar configuration steps.
