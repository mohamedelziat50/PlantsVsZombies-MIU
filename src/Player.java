    Notes for UML:

    Having all plant's health and waiting time will be redundant stored inside the class, utilize yard or level.
    The Yard class or Level can manage plant placements and interactions.
    The Player class doesn't need to store this data directly.
    For example, the Yard class could hold a List<Plant> representing plants currently placed in the yard.

    Our way: Aggregation: If the MainMenu "owns" the Player object but the Player can exist independently
     (e.g., multiple menus accessing the same user object), aggregation makes sense.

    Composition: If the Player object is tightly bound to the MainMenu and cannot exist without it
    (e.g., created when MainMenu is initialized and destroyed alongside it), use composition.

    The Player object doesnâ€™t directly deal with gameplay, it only tracks progress through the List<Level>.
